Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient,  such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country,  the cost of living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas.\n## Rationale:\nMonitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas.  National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country\u2019s specific economic  and social circumstances and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.\n## Limitations:\nNational poverty estimates are derived from household survey data. Caveats and limitations  inherent to survey data applying to the construction of indicator 1.1.1 apply here as well.","UNIT_MEASURE":"","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","ADJUSTMENT":"","IMPUTATION":"","REG_AGG":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-02-07","national_data_updated_date":"2023-02-07","indicator_number":"1.2.2","target_number":"1.2","goal_number":"1","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"01-02-02","indicator_name":"Proporcio\u0301n de hombres, mujeres y nin\u0303os de todas las edades que viven en la pobreza, en todas sus dimensiones, con arreglo a las definiciones nacionales","graph_title":"Proporcio\u0301n de hombres, mujeres y nin\u0303os de todas las edades que viven en la pobreza, en todas sus dimensiones, con arreglo a las definiciones nacionales"}
