  ## Definition:
  
  Less than one percent of the United States' population lives below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day. 
  In Alabama, we publish a proxy indicator for extreme poverty (the percentage of the population earning less than 50 
  percent of the federal poverty line). According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2019, the poverty 
  threshold in Alabama is $6.8 for people without children, $8.8 for those with one child, $11.07 for people with two 
  children, and $13.34 for people with three children per hour. The mean of the hourly wage was determined and multiplied 
  by 8 hours for a day wage. The sum was then split by two, resulting in around $33 per day.
