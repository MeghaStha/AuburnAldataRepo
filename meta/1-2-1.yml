  ## Definition:
  
  The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living below the national poverty line.
    
  ## Concepts:
  
  26.3% of the population of Auburn, AL (15,8k out of 60,2k) whose poverty status is determined lives below the poverty line, 
  which is higher than the national average of 12.8%. Males 18 to 24 years old are the largest group living in poverty, followed by 
  females 18 to 24 years old and finally males 25 to 34 years old.

  Whites are most likely to live below the poverty line in Auburn, Alabama, followed by Blacks and Asians.

  To determine who qualifies as poor, the Census Bureau utilizes a series of income standards that vary by family size and composition. 
  If a family's total income is less than the poverty threshold, then the entire family is regarded to be living in poverty.
