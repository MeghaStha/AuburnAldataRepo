  ## Definition:
  
  The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living below the national poverty line.
    
  ## Concepts:
  
  In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty according to national definitions,
  one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country.
  Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, 
  such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country, 
  the cost of living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
  
  ## Rationale:
  
  Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas. 
  National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the countryâ€™s specific economic 
  and social circumstances and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.
  
  ## Limitations:
  
  National poverty estimates are derived from household survey data. Caveats and limitations 
  inherent to survey data applying to the construction of indicator 1.1.1 apply here as well.
