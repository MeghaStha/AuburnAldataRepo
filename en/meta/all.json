According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2019, the poverty  threshold in Alabama is $6.8 for people without children, $8.8 for those with one child, $11.07 for people with two  children, and $13.34 for people with three children per hour. The mean of the hourly wage was determined and multiplied  by 8 hours for a day wage. The sum was then split by two, resulting in around $33 per day.\n## Data Sources:\nIt uses American Community Survey 5-year Estimates","UNIT_MEASURE":"Percentage","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"https://data.census.gov/table?q=s1703&g=1600000US0103076,0107000&tid=ACSST5Y2021.S1703 https://datausa.io/profile/geo/auburn-al?sexAgeRacePoverty=raceGenderOption","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","ADJUSTMENT":"","IMPUTATION":"","REG_AGG":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"Auburn,Al","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":"","es":{"SDG_GOAL":"Meta 1: Poner fin a la pobreza en todas sus formas y en todo el mundo","SDG_TARGET":"Objetivo 1.1: De aqu\u00ed a 2030, erradicar para todas las personas y en todo el mundo la pobreza extrema (actualmente se considera que sufren pobreza extrema las personas que viven con menos de 1,25 d\u00f3lares de los Estados Unidos al d\u00eda)","SDG_INDICATOR":"Indicador 1.1.1: Proporci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n que vive por debajo del umbral de pobreza internacional por sexo, edad, situaci\u00f3n laboral y ubicaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica (urbana/rural)","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"","META_LAST_UPDATE":"","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"","CONTACT_NAME":"","ORGANISATION_UNIT":"","CONTACT_FUNCT":"","CONTACT_PHONE":"","CONTACT_MAIL":"","CONTACT_EMAIL":"","STAT_CONC_DEF":"## Definici\u00f3n:\nEl indicador \"proporci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n por debajo del umbral de pobreza internacional\" se define como el porcentaje de la poblaci\u00f3n que vive con menos de 1,90 d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda a precios internacionales de 2011. La l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional se fija actualmente en 1,90 d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda a precios internacionales de 2011.\n\n## Conceptos:\nAl evaluar la pobreza en un pa\u00eds determinado y la mejor manera de reducirla, naturalmente uno se enfoca en una l\u00ednea de pobreza que se considera apropiada para ese pa\u00eds. Pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo hablamos de manera significativa sobre \"la pobreza global\"? Las l\u00edneas de pobreza entre pa\u00edses var\u00edan en t\u00e9rminos de su poder adquisitivo y tienen un fuerte gradiente econ\u00f3mico, de modo que los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s ricos tienden a adoptar niveles de vida m\u00e1s altos al definir la pobreza. Pero para medir consistentemente la pobreza absoluta global en t\u00e9rminos de consumo, necesitamos tratar a dos personas con el mismo poder adquisitivo sobre los productos b\u00e1sicos de la misma manera - ambos son pobres o no lo son - incluso si viven en pa\u00edses diferentes.\n\nDesde el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, el Banco Mundial se ha propuesto aplicar un est\u00e1ndar com\u00fan para medir la pobreza extrema, anclado en lo que significa la pobreza en los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s pobres del mundo. El bienestar de las personas que viven en diferentes pa\u00edses se puede medir en una escala com\u00fan ajustando las diferencias en el poder adquisitivo de las monedas. Para el Informe sobre el desarrollo mundial de 1990, se eligi\u00f3 el est\u00e1ndar de 1 d\u00f3lar al d\u00eda, medido a precios internacionales de 1985 y ajustado a la moneda local mediante PPA, porque era t\u00edpico de las l\u00edneas de pobreza de los pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos en ese momento. A medida que evolucionan las diferencias en el costo de vida en todo el mundo, la l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional debe actualizarse peri\u00f3dicamente utilizando nuevos datos de precios de PPA para reflejar estos cambios. El \u00faltimo cambio fue en octubre de 2015, cuando el Banco Mundial adopt\u00f3 $ 1,90 como l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional utilizando la PPA de 2011. Antes de eso, la actualizaci\u00f3n de 2008 estableci\u00f3 la l\u00ednea de pobreza internacional en $ 1,25 utilizando la PPA de 2005. Las medidas de pobreza basadas en l\u00edneas de pobreza internacionales intentan mantener constante el valor real de la l\u00ednea de pobreza en todos los pa\u00edses, como se hace al hacer comparaciones en el tiempo. Las primeras ediciones de los Indicadores de desarrollo mundial (WDI) del Banco Mundial' utilizaban las PPA de las Penn World Tables para convertir los valores en moneda local al poder adquisitivo equivalente medido en d\u00f3lares estadounidenses. En ediciones posteriores se utilizaron estimaciones de la PPA de consumo de 1993, 2005 y 2011 elaboradas por el Programa de Comparaci\u00f3n Internacional (PCI) del Banco Mundial'.","UNIT_MEASURE":"","CLASS_SYSTEM":"","SOURCE_TYPE":"","COLL_METHOD":"","FREQ_COLL":"","REL_CAL_POLICY":"","DATA_SOURCE":"","COMPILING_ORG":"","INST_MANDATE":"","RATIONALE":"","REC_USE_LIM":"","DATA_COMP":"","DATA_VALIDATION":"","ADJUSTMENT":"","IMPUTATION":"","REG_AGG":"","DOC_METHOD":"","QUALITY_MGMNT":"","QUALITY_ASSURE":"","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"","COVERAGE":"","COMPARABILITY":"","OTHER_DOC":""},"national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-02-10","national_data_updated_date":"2023-02-07","target_number":"1.1","goal_number":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-01-01"},"2-2-3":{"composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Prevalence

Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient,  such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country,  the cost of living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas.\n## Rationale:\nMonitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas.  National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the country\u2019s specific economic  and social circumstances and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.\n## Limitations:\nNational poverty estimates are derived from household survey data.
